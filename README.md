route management system
## School Bus Route Manager

## Overview
The objective of this project is to enable students to apply course concepts in a practical, real-world situation by designing and implementing a Bus Route Management System.
The project demonstrates the following:
✔ Identifying a Real-World Problem
Public transportation systems require clear management of bus routes, buses, capacities, and schedules. Manual management leads to confusion, errors, and inefficiency.
✔ Designing a Technical Solution
A software system is proposed to manage routes, buses, assignments, and allow searching/interacting with transportation data.
✔ Implementing the System
The project is implemented in Python using object-oriented programming, modular design, and a user-friendly console interface.
✔ Demonstrating Understanding
All functional and non-functional requirements are documented, and technical design artefacts (UML, workflow, architecture) are provided.
