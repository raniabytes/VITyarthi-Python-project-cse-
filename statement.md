# Bus Route Management System

## Problem Statement
Managing bus routes and buses manually can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient. Tracking which buses are assigned to which routes, adding new buses or routes, and searching for specific routes requires an organized and easy-to-use system. This project aims to automate and simplify bus route management through a simple console-based application.

## Scope of the Project
The project focuses on providing an in-memory management system for bus routes and buses. It allows users to:
- Add, view, and search bus routes.
- Add and view buses.
- Assign buses to specific routes.
- Manage and track buses and routes efficiently.
The system provides a clear and interactive command-line interface to simplify bus management operations.

## Target Users
- Transport companies or bus operators managing small to medium-sized fleets.
- Bus station managers who need to track buses and routes efficiently.
- Students or beginners learning Python and object-oriented programming (OOP).

## High-Level Features
1. **Add and View Routes**
   - Create new routes with unique IDs, start and end points, and intermediate stops.
   - Display all available routes in a clear format.

2. **Add and View Buses**
   - Add buses with unique IDs and seating capacities.
   - Display all buses along with their assigned routes (if any).

3. **Assign Buses to Routes**
   - Link a bus to a specific route to manage fleet allocation efficiently.

4. **Search Routes**
   - Find routes by specifying start and end locations.

5. **Interactive Menu System**
   - User-friendly console menu for easy navigation and operation.
   - Input validation and feedback messages to guide the user.
